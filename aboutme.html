          <h1>Seeking out life</h1>
          <p>Ever since my last year of high school, I felt like I wanted more with my life. I needed to get out of the school system to find my purpose and motivation again. The urge to go out into the world and push myself to my mental and physical limits was very high - and so I went. </p>

          <h1>Away from the Netherlands</h1>
          <p>I decided to become a ski instructor, even though I had no prior experience in skiing whatsoever. I did a 5 week course with a Danish company called Snowminds in Austria and passed with flying colors. I taught the rest of the season in the area of Kaprun in Austria and I spent a total of 6,5 months abroad.</p>

          <p>Coming home after the season, I wished to persue my new founded love for teaching and instructing, and I was hired to become an indoor skydiving instructor in CitySkydive in The Netherlands.</p>

          <h1>Becoming a teamleader and yet another winter</h1>
          <p>After having worked in CitySkydive, I was asked to become a teamleader on the same 5-week course I had participated in the year before. During that course I decided to do yet another season and this is where I also passed my second ski instructor education.</p>
